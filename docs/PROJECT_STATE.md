# AETHER Project State

**Last verified:** 2026-10-11  
**Current phase:** Phase 1, Stage 0 complete  
**Status:** VERIFIED BASELINE — awaiting approval before model integration

## Completed

- CPython 3.11.9 repository-local environment verified.
- Editable installation from `pyproject.toml` completed without global packages.
- Resolved dependency snapshot recorded in `requirements-lock.txt`.
- Full suite verified after manifest hardening: 85 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- All documented target, attack, P3, P4, and end-to-end smokes passed.
- Invalid build backend, undeclared pandas dependency, and missing `Any` import fixed.
- Run-manifest builder, validation, artifact hashing, timing fields, atomic writer, CLI, tests, and Stage-0 manifest added.
- Minimal GitHub Actions Windows/Python 3.11 workflow added.

## Partial or pending external verification

- Target, attack, instrumentation, DCMG, and remediation paths remain rule-based or synthetic.
- Existing experiment entry points do not yet invoke the manifest writer automatically; the tested CLI records completed runs.
- The exact filename `ProjectDescription.md` is absent. `4_ProjectDescription.md` is the current additive-platform/DCMG/BVP document and remains untracked.
- CI uses the locally passing command but has not run on GitHub yet.

## Known issues

- `.pytest_cache` is inaccessible, producing one non-fatal warning.
- `py -3.11` is not available in the agent shell PATH.
- PowerShell execution policy blocks `.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1`; direct interpreter invocation works.
- Benchmark registry pins and hashes remain `TBD` until later approved stages.

## Next proposed task

After explicit approval, design the bounded real-model selection and hook non-interference task. Do not download a model until that task and exact revision are approved.
